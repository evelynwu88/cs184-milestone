      We finished project 3-2 part 2 and are almost done with iridescent
      rendering. For project 3-2 part 2, we followed the course specs. For
      iridescent rendering, we followed this tutorial. In thin film interference
      (a key component of iridescent rendering), we model light as waves instead
      of photons. As light waves reflect back and forth within the thin film and
      exit the thin film at different locations, the phases of the resulting
      waves could cancel each other out or amplify each other, creating
      iridescence. The details of the math and physics involved are covered in
      the tutorial.

      Here are some of the preliminary results for project 3-2 part 2 and
      iridescent rendering:

      We have been following our proposed schedule mostly. One thing to note is
      that we proposed to refactor code to account for lights with different
      wavelengths. We thought this was necessary because human eyes have three
      different color preceptors, and project 3-1 and project 3-2 mostly model
      light as photons instead of waves. However, upon closer inspection, we
      realized that the microfacet BSDF Fresnel term in project 3-2 part 2
      actually accounts for lights of different color channels, so we created a
      new BSDF similar to microfacet BSDF where we only modified the Fresnel
      terms to allow iridescent rendering. So far we have modeled the thin film
      with constant thickness, so more work needs to be done to make it have
      varying thickness.
    </p>

      We will stick with our current work plan, so we are planning to finish up
      iridescent rendering and black body radiation. We had some brainstorm
      sessions on how to do iridescent rendering for soap bubbles (our stretch
      goal) but havenâ€™t had any luck. If time permits, we will take a deeper
      dive into the problem.
